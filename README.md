# COMS3101
Final project for COMS 3101 Programming Languages: Python. Columbia University, Fall 2019. Co-authored with [@dianasro](https://github.com/dianasro). 
Our script takes in two command line arguments: a Twitter username, and a number of tweets to search through. It then makes an API query to Twitter and does some data processing and visualization to provide insights into that user's behavior and habits on the platform.
